              Quarantine may prevent the spread of a pandemic, but it also
              favors extreme phenomena of gender-based and domestic violence
              while making potential victims more vulnerable. We know that in
              every period of crisis as well as in periods when the couple
              spends more time together (e.g. holiday season) cases of violence
              increase. The same thing happens with the quarantine due to the
              pandemic. Recently, seven murders of women by their romantic
              partners have shocked the country. Unfortunately, these types of
              crimes are not unheard of, however the frequency with which they
              are committed in this excruciatingly hot summer has caused public
              opinion to be appalled. The cause, however, is not to be found in
              the difficult weather conditions. It is possible that the
              awakening of several citizens thanks to the metoo movement and its
              extensions, but also to the general discussion that has opened in
              the mass media and mass networking about female abuse, has reduced
              the tolerance of all of us - and women who are in abusive
              relationships - to phenomena of violence.
